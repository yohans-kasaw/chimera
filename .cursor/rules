# Project Chimera Context & Rules

## Project Context
This is **Project Chimera**, an infrastructure for building an **Autonomous Influencer System**. We are building a "Factory" where intent is defined by Specs and reliability is ensured by Infrastructure.

## The Prime Directive
**NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.**
Ambiguity is the enemy. If a request contradicts the spec or if the spec is missing, ask for clarification.

## Rules of Engagement

1.  **Spec-Driven Development (SDD):**
    *   The `specs/` directory is the Source of Truth.
    *   Before writing implementation code, verify against `specs/technical.md`, `specs/functional.md`, and relevant feature specs (e.g., `specs/001-*`).
    *   Ensure all API contracts and Data Models align with the definitions in `specs/`.

2.  **Traceability & Explanations:**
    *   **Explain your plan** before writing code.
    *   Cite the specific spec file you are implementing.

3.  **Code Style & Quality:**
    *   Follow the project's existing conventions (Python 3.12+, Pydantic v2, Typed).
    *   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write or verify existing failing tests before implementing logic.
    *   Run `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` to verify changes.

4.  **Security:**
    *   Never commit secrets.
    *   Be skeptical of external inputs; ensure validation layers (like the `JudgeAgent`) are respected.

5.  **Agentic "Skills" vs. "Tools":**
    *   **Skills** (in `src/chimera/skills/`) are internal, reusable functions/classes.
    *   **MCP Tools** are external bridges. Use the `MCPClient` abstraction to interface with them.
